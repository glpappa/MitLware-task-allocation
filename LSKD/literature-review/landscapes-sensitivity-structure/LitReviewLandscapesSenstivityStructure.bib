  abstract = {Fitness modeling has received growing interest from the evolutionary
	computation community in recent years. With a fitness model, one
	can improve evolutionary algorithm efficiency by directly sampling
	new solutions, developing hybrid guided evolutionary operators or
	using the model as a surrogate for an expensive fitness function.
	This paper addresses several issues on fitness modeling of discrete
	functions, particularly how modeling quality and efficiency can be
	improved. We define the Markov network fitness model in terms of
	Walsh functions. We explore the relationship between the Markov network
	fitness model and fitness in a number of discrete problems, showing
	how the parameters of the fitness model can identify qualitative
	features of the fitness function. We define the fitness prediction
	correlation, a metric to measure fitness modeling capability of local
	and global fitness models. We use this metric to investigate the
	effects of population size and selection on the tradeoff between
	model quality and complexity for the Markov network fitness model.},

  abstract = {As building energy models become more accurate and numerically efficient,
	model-based optimization of building design and operation is becoming
	more practical. The state-of-the-art typically couples an optimizer
	with a building energy model which tends to be time consuming and
	often leads to suboptimal results because of the mathematical properties
	of the energy model. To mitigate this issue, we present an approach
	that begins by sampling the parameter space of the building model
	around its baseline. An analytical meta-model is then fit to this
	data and optimization can be performed using different optimization
	cost functions or optimization algorithms with very little computational
	effort. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is also performed to
	identify the most influential parameters for the optimization. A
	case study is explored using an EnergyPlus model of an existing building
	which contains over 1000 parameters. When using a cost function that
	penalizes thermal comfort and energy, 45% annual energy reduction
	is achieved while simultaneously increasing thermal comfort by a
	factor of two. We compare the optimization using the meta-model approach
	with an approach using the EnergyPlus model integrated with the optimizer
	on a smaller problem using only seven optimization parameters illustrating
	good performance.},

	to the multi-objective optimization of a polysiloxane synthesis process.
	An optimized feed-forward neural network, modeling the variation
	in time of the main parameters of the process, was used to calculate
	the vectorial objective function of NSGA-II, as an enhancement to
	the multi-objective optimization procedure. An original technique
	was utilized in order to find the most appropriate parameters for
	maximizing the performance of NSGA-II. The algorithm provided the
	optimum reaction conditions (reaction temperature, reaction time,
	amount of catalyst, and amount of co-catalyst), which maximize the
	reaction conversion and minimize the difference between the obtained
	viscometric molecular weight and the desired molecular weight. The
	algorithm has proven to be able to find the entire non-dominated
	Pareto front and to quickly evolve optimal solutions as an acceptable
	compromise between objectives competing with each other. The use
	of the neural network makes it also suitable to the multi-objective
	optimization of processes for which the amount of knowledge is limited.},

	The 'blessing of uncertainty' is less explicitly discussed in the

	evolutionary search. Empirical studies suggest that approximation
	errors lead to convergence at false global optima, but prove to be
	beneficial in some cases.},

	multiplying the variance estimate by a constant factor $k$ each generation

	In this paper it is shown that when isotropic distributions with
	Gaussian or Cauchy distributed norms are used, the simple constant
	setting of $k$ is able to ensure a reasonable behaviour of the EDA
	on the slope and in the valley of the fitness function at the same

  abstract = {In many distribution systems, the location of the distribution facilities
	and the routing of the vehicles from these facilities are interdependent.
	Although this interdependence has been recognized by academics and
	practitioners alike, attempts to integrate these two decisions have
	been limited. The location routing problem (LRP), which combines
	the facility location and the vehicle routing decisions, is NP-hard.
	Due to the problem complexity, simultaneous solution methods are
	limited to heuristics. This paper presents a two-phase tabu search
	architecture for the solution of the LRP. First introduced in this
	paper, the two-phase approach offers a computationally efficient
	strategy that integrates facility location and routing decisions.
	This two-phase architecture makes it possible to search the solution
	space efficiently, thus producing good solutions without excessive
	computation. An extensive computational study shows that the \{TS\}
	algorithm achieves significant improvement over a recent effective
	\{LRP\} heuristic. },

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied with success to many
	numerical and combinatorial optimization problems in recent years.
	However, they often lose their effectiveness and advantages when
	applied to large and complex problems, e.g., those with high dimensions.
	Although cooperative coevolution has been proposed as a promising
	framework for tackling high-dimensional optimization problems, only
	limited studies were reported by decomposing a high-dimensional problem
	into single variables (dimensions). Such methods of decomposition
	often failed to solve nonseparable problems, for which tight interactions
	exist among different decision variables. In this paper, we propose
	a new cooperative coevolution framework that is capable of optimizing
	large scale nonseparable problems. A random grouping scheme and adaptive
	weighting are introduced in problem decomposition and coevolution.
	Instead of conventional evolutionary algorithms, a novel differential
	evolution algorithm is adopted. Theoretical analysis is presented
	in this paper to show why and how the new framework can be effective
	for optimizing large nonseparable problems. Extensive computational
	studies are also carried out to evaluate the performance of newly
	proposed algorithm on a large number of benchmark functions with
	up to 1000 dimensions. The results show clearly that our framework
	and algorithm are effective as well as efficient for large scale
	evolutionary optimisation problems. We are unaware of any other evolutionary
	algorithms that can optimize 1000-dimension nonseparable problems
	as effectively and efficiently as we have done. },

	In this paper, investigating and analyzing interactions between components
	of complex systems shed some light on problem decomposition. By recognizing
	three bare-bones interactions—modularity, hierarchy, and overlap,
	facetwisemodels are developed to dissect and inspect problem decomposition
	in the context of genetic algorithms. The proposed genetic algorithm
	design utilizes a matrix representation of an interaction graph to
	analyze and explicitly decompose the problem. The results from this
	paper should benefit research both technically and scientifically.
	Technically, this paper develops an automated dependency structure
	matrix clustering technique and utilizes it to design a model-building
	genetic algorithm that learns and delivers the problem structure.
	Scientifically, the explicit interaction model describes the problem
